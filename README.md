# exiftoolall

A small utility program that removes all metadata from image files (i.e. `png`, `jpeg`, `jpg`) in a directory. It uses the `-all` option in [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) to remove the image metadata (see [ExifTool documentation](https://exiftool.org/#limitations) for specific limitations). The original files are also overwritten.

Requires [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) in PATH.
